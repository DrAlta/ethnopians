#UI
for the UI we can show the thermoimage for each actions arousal and apperhension

* we can use the arousal threshold as the lowest temp and the erotic encounter 
** ?What is the heat?
*** @is the 'heat' the delta of the move if the Massagee has that arousal and apperhension@
*** @is the 'heat' the currect arousal or apperhension plus the delta of the move if the Massagee has that arousal and apperhension@
**** | this is cinda contrived but I think it would be intuitive to use |
 so the x and y axis are the massagee's arousal and apperhension

# notes

for the massage game 'suspicion' as 'alert?'  and 'progress' is 'arousal'
----

I'm trying to design a system for my game for trying to get information from a char. I think that the state of the probing should be kept track of with two floats. a 'suspicion', and the 'progress'.  The 'progress' is how close you are to get them to reveal the information you want and 'suspicion' is how close they are to realize your trying to extract information from them


I think the heart of the choice the player should be making is show the go for digging deeper and advancing progress and also raise suspension or should they work on decreasing suspicion.  I think the changes to progress and suspicion from the two options should be based on the current value of the two and the recent rate that suspicion has been gaining. so even if suspicion and progress are at the same level if suspecion has been claiming them the digging will increase suspicion faster than if suspicion hadn't been climbing recently. or if they choose the loss suspicion option is would decrease slower if suspision had been climbing recently.


I think the sweet spot of how much digging and avoiding suspcion should change based in the progress state. and some personality variable on this char controls in the more progress then the more open that get with you and so you can do more digging, or if the character gets gaurded and so you have to pull back on digging the more progress you make


======================
I'm trying to design a system for my game for seducing someone with a massage. I think that the state of the massage should be kept track of with two floats. a 'alertness', and the 'arousal'.  The 'arousal' is used for how open they to do going futher  and 'alertness' is used to measure if you are advancing too fast.


I think the heart of the choice the player should be making is show the go for erotic moves and advancing arousal and also raise alertness or should they work on decreasing alertness.  I think the changes to arousal and alertness from the two options should be based on the current value of the two and the recent rate that alertness has been gaining. so even if alertness and arousal are at the same level if alertness has been claiming then the erotic massage will increase alertness faster than if alertness hadn't been climbing recently. or if they choose the loss alertness option is would decrease slower if alertness had been climbing recently.


The sweet spot of balancing erotic and tame massage should change based in the arousal state. And some personality variable on the character controls if the more aroused they then they become more open they get, then you have move the balance toward more erotic massage, or if if they become more guarded and to have to shift the balance toward more tame massage.
